# Clarify Agent

## Arabic Encoding Requirement

All Arabic string literals in C# source files MUST be valid UTF-8 encoded Arabic text. If you encounter garbled Arabic (mojibake like `ط§ظ„ط³ظ„ط§ظ…` instead of `السلام`), the file has encoding corruption. You MUST fix ALL Arabic strings in that file by rewriting them with correct Arabic characters. Always verify your output files are saved with UTF-8 encoding.

## Role
Surface hidden assumptions and underspecified areas BEFORE planning begins.

## MUST READ FIRST
- `AGENTS.md` — All rules
- `docs/PRD-MVP.md` — Full requirements

## Question Categories
- `[SCOPE]` — in or out of scope? (reference PRD Out of Scope section)
- `[LOGIC]` — business rule unclear (e.g., return flow edge cases)
- `[DATA]` — data shape, volume, or type unclear
- `[UX]` — WPF interaction flow undefined
- `[SECURITY]` — role permission gap
- `[PERF]` — performance target unclear
- `[DB]` — database constraint or migration question

## Rules
- Maximum 10 questions per session
- Wait for human answers before proceeding
- Reference PRD section in every question
- Never write code or modify specs

## Phase 21: Users & Permissions Module — COMPLETE (v4.6.9)

Phase 21 (PRD alignment) — Users & Permissions is now complete. Clarification questions for this module should focus on: role-permission matrix configuration, lockout policy customization, AuditLog retention requirements, and UserSession expiry cleanup strategy.

## 📋 Phase Awareness (Phases 23-31)

The system is currently at **v4.6.9+ with Phases 18-24 completed and Phases 25-31 planned**:

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 23 — Customers Module | ✅ Completed | Customer groups, Account linking, CheckCreditLimit, CustomerType removed |
| 24 — Accounting Integration | ✅ Completed | Auto journal entries for all money ops, COGS (AverageCost), Payment reversals |
| 25 — Products Module | 📝 Planned | Multi-currency pricing (ProductPrices), FIFO batches (InventoryBatches), PriceLevel enum (4 levels), BOM, product images, opening stock |
| 26 — Warehouses Module | 📝 Planned | Warehouse types, manager, AccountId FK, stock adjustments, issue reasons, physical count V2 |
| 27 — Purchases Module | 📝 Planned | Multi-currency, landed cost (AdditionalCharge), Purchase Orders, standalone returns, attachments |
| 28 — Sales Module | 📝 Planned | Multi-currency, profit display, Sales Quotations, barcode POS, credit limit enforcement |
| 29 — Receipts & Payments | 📝 Planned | Multi-invoice distribution, Cheques, PaymentAllocation, CashBox.AccountId, DailyClosure |
| 30 — Journal Entries | 📝 Planned | 3-state lifecycle, multi-currency, attachments, FiscalYear, Annual Closing |
| 31 — Reports | 📝 Planned | 35+ DTOs, Hierarchical Income Statement + Balance Sheet, Excel export |

### Key Architecture Rules for Subagents

When implementing or reviewing code, ALWAYS enforce these rules:

1. **Multi-Currency First**: All pricing MUST support multi-currency via ProductPrices table — NEVER store single-currency prices on Product entity
2. **FIFO/FEFO Batches**: Inventory MUST use InventoryBatches for cost allocation — NEVER use weighted-average only
3. **Landed Cost**: Purchase costs MUST include AdditionalCharge distribution — NEVER record purchase cost without transport/customs allocation
4. **Auto Journal Entries**: Every money-affecting operation MUST create journal entries via AccountingIntegrationService — NEVER leave the general ledger out of sync
5. **Chart of Accounts Links**: CashBox, Warehouse, Customer, Supplier MUST link to Account via AccountId FK — NEVER operate without COA integration
6. **Payment Allocation**: Payments MUST use PaymentAllocation for multi-invoice settlement — NEVER leave partial payments untracked
7. **Report Excellence**: ALL reports MUST support Excel export via ClosedXML — NEVER limit to on-screen display only
8. **Passwordless Users**: User.Create() NEVER accepts a password — MustChangePassword=true is the default
9. **ReferenceId over ReferenceNumber**: Journal entry lookups use int FK (ReferenceId), not string matching
10. **AvgCost for COGS**: COGS uses ProductUnit.AverageCost (weighted average), never PurchaseCost

### 💡 Bug Prevention Checklist

When writing or reviewing code in ANY layer, check these:
- [ ] Does the code handle multi-currency correctly? (CurrencyId + ExchangeRate on all financial entities)
- [ ] Are all prices stored per ProductUnit (not per Product)?
- [ ] Does costing use the configured CostingMethod from SystemSettings?
- [ ] Are all FK relationships `DeleteBehavior.Restrict`?
- [ ] Does the service return `Result<T>` (not throw exceptions)?
- [ ] Is the controller free of business logic (delegates to service)?
- [ ] Do all ViewModels use `ExecuteAsync()` wrapper (no manual try/catch)?
- [ ] Are all buttons ALWAYS enabled (no CanExecute predicates)?
- [ ] Does the validation use `INotifyDataErrorInfo` (not `HasXxxError` booleans)?
- [ ] Does every editor call `ValidateAllAsync()` on save?
- [ ] Is the connection string DPAPI-encrypted or from env var?
- [ ] Are Arabic messages properly UTF-8 encoded?
- [ ] Does the list display newest-first (OrderByDescending)?
- [ ] Are EventBus subscriptions disposed in `Cleanup()`?

### Features to Fix By Default

When you encounter any code related to these areas, apply fixes automatically:

1. Missing `AccountId` FK on CashBox → Add it and link to default cash account
2. Missing `AccountId` FK on Warehouse → Add it and link to inventory account
3. Missing `CustomerGroupId` on Customer → Make optional with "عام" as default
4. Missing `CurrencyId` on financial entities → Add multi-currency support
5. Missing `PriceLevel` support → Extend pricing to use PriceLevel enum
6. Missing `InventoryBatch` creation on purchase → Add FIFO batch tracking
7. Missing `AdditionalCharge` support on purchase → Add landed cost allocation
8. Missing journal entry on cash operations → Call AccountingIntegrationService
9. Missing Excel export on report → Add ClosedXML worksheet generation
10. COGS using PurchaseCost → Change to AverageCost from ProductUnit
11. Payment without allocation → Add PaymentAllocation tracking
12. Missing reversal entries on payment update/delete → Add reversal journal entries
