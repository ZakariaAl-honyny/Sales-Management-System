# Specification Quality Checklist: Product Lifecycle & Media Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. The specification correctly translates the PRD technical requirements into user-focused scenarios. It defines the "what" and "why" for optional expiration dates, image uploads (including the crucial requirement that the DB doesn't bloat), proactive UX notifications, and the financial impact of stock write-offs, while leaving the EF Core schemas and MVVM implementation details to the upcoming planning phase.
